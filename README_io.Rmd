## This webpage describes the workflow and analyses of the 10000 genomes of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

The aim of this project investigate global transmission dynamics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the period 2015 - 2018. To do so we have collected a globally diverse sample 

#### Data preparation
Data preparation: Collection info, alignment, recombination masking, snp-calling are described in the paper (link will be posted). 

##### Phylogeny
The phylogenetic tree was produced by using [FastTree v.2.1](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009490)
Scaling of the genetic distance to time was done using [LSD2](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syv068) with two clades constrained to date estimates derived in previous studies (see paper text).

The R-shiny app above displays the estimated [transmission lineages](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf2946), size, estimated arrival time, lineage plots and metadata of the sequences belonging to them. To estimate the transmission lineages we have used the R-package [LineageHomology](https://github.com/magnusnosnes/LineageHomology).

### [Import and local transmission analyses](Analyses/LineagesAndImport.html)

[![Test](Files/Import_local_transmission.png)](Analyses/LineagesAndImport.html)

This analysis provides estimates of the total number of importation and local transmission events in each location. Additinally we use the transmission lineages to derive importation and local transmission over time.

### [Growth rate of lineages and relation to metadata](Analyses/Growth_rates_explanatory.html)

[![Test](Files/Metadata.png)](Analyses/Growth_rates_explanatory.html)


This analysis explores the relation of the growth rate of the transmission in the period 2010-2017 and the final size of the transmission lineages, to the metadata of the sequences belonging to those TLs. We extract phylodynamic estimates of the growth rate, and use the lineage size estimated using LineageHomology and run regression analysis to explore the correlation of
