## This webpage describes a subset of the analyses for the paper *The inter-continental population dynamics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
 
The aim of this project was to investigate global transmission dynamics of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* in the period 2015 - 2018. To do so we collected a globally diverse sample of sequences a high representation of sequences from Australia (n=2203), Norway (n=1724), USA (n=2372) and diverse set of other countries from each continent (n=3434).
